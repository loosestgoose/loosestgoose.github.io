In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at Abbott Hematology in Santa Clara, California. As part of the On-Market Engineering team, I was focused on sustaining engineering for the Abbott Alinity h-series instruments.

My keystone project of the summer was consolidating information for a feasbiility review of a GMI project, setting up my team to be able to continue the project once I left.
