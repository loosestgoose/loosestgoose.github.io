<p>Homecoming at my high school was a big deal, but not necessarily because of our football team (for reference, the football team lost the Homecoming game 49-10). Rather, Homecoming was a week-long competition between the classes, with activities like cardboard boat racing, Night Rally, a Super Smash Bros tournament, and, of course, the floats.</p>

<p>Affectionately named G'Floats, these stationary "floats" lived on campus during the week of Homecoming. In the weeks leading up to Hoco, a team of volunteers from each class would design, build, and assemble their class floats. I was part of the g'floats team for all of my years at Gunn High School.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the floats are based off of a dress-up theme assigned to each class. For the seniors, this tends to be America- and what's more American than landing the first man on the moon? Our senior year float was inspired by the Apollo 11 Lunar Module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of just under two months, the I lead the volunteer team in designing and constructing the body of our senior float. The goal was to create a 1:2 wooden replica of the Lunar Module that towered above the underclassmen, striking fear and awe into their hearts. We designed all the components in CAD before assembling the wooden pieces and panels. Upon completion, the float was over 10' tall, featured a motorized opening hatch (to reveal an intrepid explorer inside), and speakers and LED lights to accentuate the exhaust plume.</p>
