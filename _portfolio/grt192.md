<p>In my senior year of high school, I was elected Team Manager of the 50-person Gunn Robotics Team, which competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Team Manager, I was primarily focused on improving team communication, building a strong team culture and community, and ensuring that the team would be successful after I graduated. In the fall semester, before the "Build Season" in Spring semester, I focused on organizing and leading activities to train incoming team members in safe power tool usage, design standards and processes, and encourage rookies to bond with veteran members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During competition season, I worked with the rest of the leadership team to schedule shop supervision, make (and follow) timelines, and work with mechanical leads to make design decisions.</p>
