<h2>CWRU Motorsports</h2>
<h3>CAD Onboarding Lead</h3>
<p>I started an initiative on our team to improve the onboarding process for new members. I created a 6-week curriculum to train oncoming team members in drawing/drafting standards, CAD modelling, and making assemblies. Over the course of these 6 weeks, I helped over 50 prospective members develop the technical skills that they would need to be successful as engineers and at CWRU Baja. The course resources can be found at this <a href="https://selective-gondola-eba.notion.site/CWRUM-CAD-Onboarding-9d124151de954b13ae7d16d2be454d17?pvs=74">website I compiled</a>.</p>

<h3>Cost Report Coordinator </h3>
<p> Our team was consistently getting top scores and results in the dynamic events. However, our overall scores were hurt by our static events. To improve our team's score, I've been working with the various subteam leads, as well as the manufacturing coordinator, to improve our results, make the process easier, and to improve our team's performance overall. </p>
