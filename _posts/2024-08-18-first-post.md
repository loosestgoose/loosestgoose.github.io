This is my first blog post!
Making this website is something that I have been meaning to do for a long time, so I am glad to be taking the steps to actually make it happen. Everytime I do, though, it reminds me why I've procrastinated for so long!

Some of the current issues I'm running into:
- I'm not sure how the architecture of this static "vanilla" site should look like. A lot of the website that I've used for reference (mostly from friends) use "frameworks" (<- ???) or other fancy things that I do not have the bandwidth to look at.
- I have to figure out how to actually code with HTML. I know the basics, but I'm learning a lot about the different capabilities that HTML offers (like navigation).
- The site is really ugly right now.

Stay tuned for more updates, I guess.
