  <h1> Hello there! </h1>
  <p>Thanks for visiting my website. I'm currently in my second year of pursuing a BSE in Mechanical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University.</p>
  <p>Having never coded before, I thought that this website would serve both as an online portfolio as well as an interesting foray into web dev. </p>
  <p>Visit my&nbsp;<strong>About Me </strong>page for more background, my <strong>Resume</strong> page for information about my past experiences, and my <strong>Portfolio</strong> for more information on projects I've worked on.</p>
