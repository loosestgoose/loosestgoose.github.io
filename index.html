      <h3> About this website: </h3>
      <p> This website was built to serve both as a foray into web dev and coding as well as a way to host a digital portfolio. This site is built with GitHub pages, and is currently mostly HTML and CSS (though I'd like to learn to implement things like TailwindCSS, or interactive elements offered by node.js or react.js). Special thanks to Kevin Yu (ky28059.github.io) for his help and advice. </p>

    <h2> What do I do? </h2>
    <p> I'm currently involved with the Baja SAE team at CWRU, where I design/fabricate/analyze parts, coordinate static events, and teach freshmen how to CAD. </p>
    <p> Outside of engineering, I participate in the theater program, am an avid Star Wars fan, and trying to learn new things - hence my insistence to spend hours of my life learning how to code a website (still deciding if it was worth it...). </p> </p>
