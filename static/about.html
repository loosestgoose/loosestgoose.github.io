<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm originally from the California Bay Area, though I'm currently living in Cleveland, Ohio to pursue higher education.</p>
<p>Throughout high school, I was heavily involved in school events, my high school robotics team, and perhaps surprisingly, my school theater department (maybe not so unsurprisingly, I was part of stage tech, and not part of the cast).</p>
<p>In college, I've dedicated my time to working on the&nbsp;Case Western Reserve University Motorsports team, which competes in the Baja SAE collegiate racing series. Check out my Resume or Portfolio for more details on my involvement there.</p>
